# 🚀 PeerFlow  
### Split Expenses. Not Friendships.

A graph-optimized peer-to-peer expense settlement engine that uses integer-only paise accounting, a Minimum Cash Flow algorithm (O(n log n)), and democratic governance to minimize transactions and enforce strict financial integrity.

# 1️⃣ Problem Statement

Managing shared expenses creates complex debt chains between members.  
Most existing tools calculate balances but **do not minimize the number of transactions required to settle them**.

This results in:

- Redundant transfers  
- Circular debt loops  
- Floating-point rounding errors  
- High coordination effort  
- No accountability system  

### Example

4 members share ₹12,000 across multiple expenses.

Naive settlement: 12 transactions  
PeerFlow optimized settlement: 3 transactions  

➡ **75% transaction reduction**

---

# 2️⃣ What Makes PeerFlow Different

- Global debt optimization (not pairwise settlement)
- Integer paise accounting (₹100.50 → 10050)
- Minimum Cash Flow algorithm
- Overpayment prevention at both frontend and backend
- 50% expense approval governance
- 75% overdue consensus mechanism
- Σ(net balances) = 0 invariant enforced
- D3.js before/after debt graph visualization
- 56 automated Jest tests ensuring correctness

---

# 3️⃣ Financial Integrity Model

## Integer Accounting

All monetary values are stored as integers in paise.

No floating-point arithmetic is used in financial calculations.

---

## Overpayment Protection

The maximum payable amount is computed as:

`maxAllowed = Math.min(Math.abs(debtorNet), creditorNet)`

Validation rules:

- amount ≥ 1  
- amount ≤ maxAllowed  
- debtorNet < 0  
- creditorNet > 0  

If any condition fails, the backend rejects the request.

Frontend protection:

- Input max value dynamically set  
- Inline error shown when exceeded  
- Simulate button disabled if invalid  

Overpayment is mathematically impossible in the system.

---

# 4️⃣ Minimum Cash Flow Algorithm

Complexity: O(n log n)

Algorithm Steps:

1. Compute net balance for each member  
2. Partition into creditors (+) and debtors (-)  
3. Sort creditors descending by balance  
4. Sort debtors descending by absolute value  
5. Match highest creditor with highest debtor  
6. Transfer minimum of the two  
7. Repeat until all balances become zero  

Guarantees:

- Minimum number of transactions  
- Deterministic output  
- Σ(net balances) = 0 always preserved  

---

# 5️⃣ System Architecture

User → React Frontend → Express API → Financial Engine → MongoDB → Response

Tech Stack:

- React 18 + Vite  
- Node.js + Express  
- MongoDB + Mongoose  
- JWT Authentication  
- D3.js Visualization  
- Jest Testing

# 7️⃣ Database Models

## User
- name  
- email  
- password (hashed)  

## Group
- name  
- joinCode  
- settlementThreshold  
- members[]  

## Expense
- group  
- description  
- totalAmount (paise)  
- paidBy  
- splits[]  
- status (pending / approved / rejected)  
- approvals[]  
- requiredApprovals

# 8️⃣ Governance System

Expense approval:
- Requires ≥ 50% majority  

Overdue marking:
- Requires ≥ 75% consensus  

Overdue users:
- Cannot create expense  
- Cannot vote  
- CAN repay debt

- Net balance computation  
- Split correctness  
- Floating-point prevention  
- Overpayment rejection  
- Settlement integrity  
- Algorithm correctness  
- Governance enforcement
